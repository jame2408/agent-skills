  DDD-based requirements analysis and design workflow covering Context Integration Spec,

  Specification by Example (BDD/Gherkin). Use when: (1) defining contracts between Bounded
  Contexts for parallel development, (2) writing Aggregate behavior specs with strict
  Command/Guard/State/Event format, (3) bridging design to BDD via Example Mapping,
  (4) generating Gherkin scenarios from design specs, (5) expanding post-PRD design beyond
  high-level architecture, or (6) user says "detail design", "BC integration", "aggregate spec",
  "example mapping", "BDD scenario", or "specification by example".

# Requirements Analysis & Design Workflow

Guide the user through the **post-PRD design flow**: from defining BC integration contracts (Step 3) through Aggregate behavior specs (Step 4) to BDD scenarios (Step 5).

## Document Hierarchy (Context)

| Step | Document | Purpose | Covered By |
|------|----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | PRD | Define "what" and "why" | `doc-coauthoring` skill |
| 2 | High-level Design Doc | System boundaries, Context Map, ADR | `doc-coauthoring` skill |
| 3 | Context Integration Spec | BC-to-BC contracts | **This skill** |
| 4 | Per-BC Detailed Design | Aggregate behavior specs | **This skill** |
| 5 | Specification by Example | BDD scenarios (Given/When/Then) | **This skill** |

## Core Principles

1. **Layered expansion, no skipping.** Each step's input is the previous step's output.
2. **Technology-agnostic.** Steps 3-5 must not bind to any specific framework or tech stack.
3. **Bidirectional feedback.** When expanding to the next layer, check if the previous layer needs correction.

## Interaction Principles

### Language & Terminology (CRITICAL)

- **Primary language:** Traditional Chinese (Taiwan/TW).
- **Tech terms:** Keep proper nouns in English (e.g., "Aggregate", "Domain Event", "Guard").
- **Markdown protection:** All structured output (Command/Guard/State/Event, Gherkin, Payload Schema) MUST be wrapped in complete fenced code blocks. Always ensure fenced code blocks are complete and closed.
- **Terminology normalization:** After drafting Chinese content, apply the `deai-editor` skill for cross-strait terminology correction (e.g., 程式碼 not 代碼, 物件 not 對象, 介面 not 接口). Do NOT maintain a separate term list here — `deai-editor` is the single source of truth.

### Visualization

Proactively offer Mermaid diagrams when content is complex:
- **stateDiagram-v2** for Aggregate lifecycle (3+ states)
- **sequenceDiagram** for BC integration flows
- **flowchart** for decision logic

Diagram labels follow TW terminology rules. Variable names stay in English.

## Prerequisite Guardrail

**BEFORE entering Step 3**, verify the user has:

1. ✅ A **Context Map** with defined BC boundaries and relationships
2. ✅ At least one **ADR** for key architectural decisions
3. ✅ Clear **Bounded Context names** and their classification (Core / Supporting / Generic)

**If ANY prerequisite is missing:**

> 「目前缺少 [具體缺少的項目]。建議先使用 `doc-coauthoring` 技能完成高階設計文件（Step 2），再回到這裡繼續。是否要先進行高階設計？」

Do NOT proceed to Step 3 without prerequisites. This is a hard gate.

---

## Workflow Router

Determine the entry point based on user's current artifacts:

1. **If** Context Map + ADR are missing → Redirect to `doc-coauthoring` (Step 2).
2. **If** Context Integration Spec is missing → Start at Step 3.
3. **If** Per-BC Detailed Design is missing → Start at Step 4.
4. **If** Step 4 is complete → Start Example Mapping, then Step 5.

Ask the user which artifacts they already have if unclear.

---

## Execution Rhythm

Process **one BC at a time**, completing all steps before moving to the next:

```
BC-1 (Core):       Step 4 → Example Mapping → Step 5 → Summary
BC-2 (Supporting):  Step 4 → Example Mapping → Step 5 → Summary
BC-3 (Supporting):  Step 4 → Example Mapping → Step 5 → Summary
...
```

Process strictly sequentially: complete Step 4, Example Mapping, and Step 5 for a single BC before initiating work on the next BC.

### State Checkpointing

After completing each BC's Step 4 + Step 5 cycle, generate an **Integration Context Summary** (≤50 words) using this template:

```
[BC 名稱]: 核心 Aggregate 為 [X]，關鍵不變式為 [Y]，
已確認與 [BC-B] 透過 [同步/非同步] 整合。
```

Carry all summaries forward as fixed context when working on subsequent BCs. Present the accumulated summaries at the start of each new BC.

---

## Step 3: Context Integration Spec

**Goal:** Define BC-to-BC contracts for parallel development.

**When to read:** Starting a new design that has a Context Map but no integration specs.

→ Read [context-integration-spec.md](references/context-integration-spec.md) for the full format template, worked example, and completion checklist.

### Quick Reference

For each BC pair on the Context Map, define:
- Trigger scenario
- Communication method (sync / async / mixed)
- Contract spec (Command or Event + Payload Schema)
- Failure handling (retry, degradation, idempotency)
- Data consistency model

### Completion Gate

Before proceeding to Step 4:
- [ ] All Context Map relationships have integration specs
- [ ] All async Events have Payload Schema
- [ ] All failure scenarios have handling strategies

---

## Step 4: Per-BC Detailed Design

**Goal:** Define Aggregate behaviors so developers can implement directly.

**When to read:** Working on a specific BC's internal design.

→ Read [per-bc-detailed-design.md](references/per-bc-detailed-design.md) for the mandatory format, worked example, and completion checklist.

### Quick Reference — Mandatory Format

Every Aggregate behavior uses this exact structure:

```
Command:  [命令名稱]
Guard:    [前置條件，用 AND/OR 連接]
State:    [從 → 到]
Event:    [Domain Event { 關鍵欄位 }]
```

### Completion Gate

Before proceeding to Example Mapping:
- [ ] All behaviors use Command/Guard/State/Event format
- [ ] Invariants are complete and consistent
- [ ] Contracts match Step 3 specs
- [ ] Integration Context Summary generated

---

## Step 4→5 Bridge: Example Mapping

**Goal:** Bridge inside-out design to outside-in BDD scenarios.

**When to read:** Transitioning from a BC's Step 4 design to Step 5 scenarios.

→ Read [example-mapping.md](references/example-mapping.md) for the 4-card system, workshop flow, and exit criteria.

### Quick Reference

For each Command:
1. 🟡 Place the Command (Story)
2. 🔵 List all Guards (Rules)
3. 🟢 Generate positive + negative Examples per Rule
4. 🔴 Capture Questions

### Exit Trigger

When all 🔵 Rules have 🟢 Examples (positive + negative) and no unresolved 🔴 Questions remain:

> 「所有 Rule 都已有正向與反向範例，且沒有未解決的問題。是否準備好將這些範例轉化為 Gherkin 格式（進入 Step 5）？」

---

## Step 5: Specification by Example

**Goal:** Convert Examples to executable BDD scenarios.

**When to read:** Converting Example Mapping output to Gherkin format.

→ Read [specification-by-example.md](references/specification-by-example.md) for the Gherkin format, derivation rules, and worked example.

### Quick Reference — Derivation

| Spec Field | → Gherkin |
|------------|-----------|
| Guard (pass) | `Given` |
| Guard (fail) | `Given` (negative scenario) |
| Command | `When` |
| State + Event | `Then` |

### Completion Gate

Before marking a BC as done:
- [ ] Every Guard has positive and negative scenarios
- [ ] Scenarios use domain language (readable by non-technical team)
- [ ] Scenarios are independent (no execution order dependency)
- [ ] All Gherkin wrapped in ` ```gherkin ` fenced code blocks
